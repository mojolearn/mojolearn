"""What may vary between backends, and what may not.

NOT a port. CatBoost has no equivalent and does not need one: it ships one
GPU backend and accepts a non-deterministic answer. We ship Metal, CUDA and
HIP from one source, so "the same fit gives the same model" is a property we
have to design for rather than inherit.

THE AXIS, and it is the thing that is easy to get wrong
-------------------------------------------------------
The tempting split is "numeric rows" against "scheduling rows", vary the
scheduling per vendor and pin the numerics. **That split is false**, because
some scheduling decisions ARE numeric decisions. A block count is a summation
order. A partial-sum tree shape is a summation order. How many private copies
a histogram is replicated into decides how many partial sums get combined and
in what sequence.

So a row is classified by ONE question:

    Does it change the SEQUENCE or the PRECISION of the arithmetic?

If yes it is a NUMERIC row and `NumericMode.IDENTICAL` pins it, whatever it
looks like. If no it is a SCHEDULING row and every backend picks freely, in
both modes. Grid shape, threads per block, occupancy targets, launch batching
and prefetch distance are scheduling. Accumulator width, flush order,
replication factor, block count and contraction are numeric.

WHAT A MODE CANNOT DO
---------------------
Two things escape the table and must be handled in source rather than
configured:

- **Floating-point atomics are order-nondeterministic run to run**, not just
  backend to backend. No row pins them. `IDENTICAL` has to REPLACE the
  accumulator, not configure it.
- **FMA contraction is a codegen decision.** The compiler decides whether
  `a*b+c` becomes one rounding or two. A runtime row cannot reach it; it is
  fixed at the source, per kernel.

THE COST IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT AN ARGUMENT
------------------------------------------
Because the modes differ by a named, enumerable set of rows, "what does
determinism cost" has an answer in seconds rather than in opinions. Run the
two modes interleaved and report the ratio.
