# Built here, not yet reached

**Two categories exist in this tree and only two:** `ported/` is a port of
a real file of theirs, and `mojo_only/` is something they never needed. There
is no third category of "good idea worth adopting" -- if it is in their
source it is simply PORTED or NOT PORTED YET, and this file tracks the
second.

mojotrees accumulated four fully implemented, tested, documented stages that
no default fit could reach, and it took a day to find them. This file exists
so this tree cannot repeat that quietly. **Audited by grep, not by memory.**

## Wired and driving, with a guard

| row | read by | guard |
|---|---|---|
| `block_size_for` | all four histogram kernel files | `probe_main` RAISES if a kernel's `BLOCK_SIZE` disagrees with the table |
| `hist_floats_per_thread_for` | same | same |
| `reduce_width_for` | `point_hist_half_byte_template` | same |
| `requires_uniform_iteration_for` | `hist_binary`, `hist_half_byte` | kernel refuses at comptime if the row ever says lane-sync |

## NOT wired

| thing | read by | why not, and what would change it |
|---|---|---|
| `deterministic_flush` (matrix row) | **nothing** but a doc line | No kernel does a MULTI-BLOCK flush. One block per (leaf, feature-group) owns its output slot outright, so no atomic is needed and the histograms are correct without it. The row starts mattering the moment replication across blocks exists. |
| `mojo_only/fixed_point.mojo` | **nothing** but its own check | Same reason. It is verified in isolation (overflow bound tight at 268,435,453 of 268,435,455; forward and reverse accumulation exact) and used by no kernel. |
| `column_lane_width` | `spec_for` only | Nothing needs a lane width while `sync_granularity` is `SYNC_BLOCK` everywhere. |
| one-byte histogram body | its arithmetic is ported | The kernel around it is not written; only `hist_one_byte`'s slot arithmetic exists. |
| pinned host partitions (`partsCpu`) | the kernel writes them | `update_partitions_after_split_kernel` takes `host_offset` / `host_size` and writes them, so the device half is ported. The driver must allocate those as PINNED host memory rather than ordinary device buffers, which is where the trick pays: the host then learns every leaf's size with no device-to-host copy, and the next level's smaller-sibling decision needs no readback in the critical path. |

**Consequence to state plainly, because it is the honest answer to "does the
matrix drive the fixed-point path": IT DOES NOT, YET.** Under `FAST` the
design says NVIDIA and AMD keep float atomics and only `IDENTICAL` pins them
to the integer flush, while Apple is forced regardless. None of that is in
effect, because the row has no reader.

## The rule

A row that nothing reads is indistinguishable from a row something reads.
When the multi-block flush lands, `deterministic_flush` must be consulted at
that site and this table must move it upstairs in the same commit.
