# Where CUDA does not reach Metal, and what was written instead

Every entry is a place the port could not be literal. The rule is to write
the closest thing and record it here, never to substitute a better idea, so
that if this tree ends up slow we can tell their design from our
interpretation of it.

## 1. Threadgroup memory: 48 KB wanted, 32 KB available

Every CatBoost histogram kernel sizes its shared buffer to **49,152 bytes**:

- one-byte: `BlockSize * 32` floats at `BlockSize = 384`
  (`hist_one_byte.cu:22-24`, `:421`)
- half-byte and binary: `BlockSize * 16` floats at `BlockSize = 768`
  (`point_hist_half_byte_template.cuh:18-20`, `hist_half_byte.cu:72`,
  `hist_binary.cu:86`)

Apple silicon caps threadgroup memory at 32 KB. The buffer size is
`BlockSize * 16` floats, so the block size is what has to give:
**`BlockSize = 512` gives exactly 32,768 bytes** and **`BlockSize = 256`
gives 16 KB** with room for anything else the kernel needs.

Ported at **`BLOCK_SIZE = 512`**, which asks for exactly 32,768 bytes: the
largest block that fits. This is a real deviation and it costs replication:
CatBoost gets `BlockSize / 32 = 24` per-warp copies of the histogram to
reduce contention, and 512 gives 16.

**And it nearly introduced a silent wrong answer.** `Reduce()` writes the
literal 512 in its first stage (`if (threadIdx.x < 512)`,
`point_hist_half_byte_template.cuh:123-133`), which is safe at their
BlockSize of 768 and is NOT safe below it. At a first-cut `BLOCK_SIZE = 256`
stage 1 would have written only slots 0-255 while stage 2 goes on to read up
to `32 * 15 + 7 + 24 = 511`, so half the histogram would have been read as
whatever the scratch happened to hold. The port carries `REDUCE_WIDTH =
min(BLOCK_SIZE, 512)` and an outer slot loop so the stage covers all 512
slots with whatever block size is configured. At 512 it runs once and is
their loop verbatim.

This is the first hazard the port has surfaced that is invisible in the
original: a constant that is only correct in conjunction with a block size we
cannot use.

## 2. There are no warp-level primitives in Mojo 1.0

CatBoost's accumulator is conflict-free by construction rather than by
atomics. `SliceOffset()` hands each 32-lane warp its own 512-float copy and
each group of 8 lanes its own sub-copy, and `AddPoint` rotates which feature
a lane handles with `(threadIdx.x + i) & 7`, so within one iteration no two
lanes of the tile touch the same slot. Between iterations it calls
`tiled_partition<8>(this_thread_block()).sync()` -- an **8-lane barrier**.

Mojo 1.0 exposes only `barrier()`, which is threadgroup-wide. So the port
widens an 8-lane sync to a 256-thread sync. **This is correct but strictly
more expensive**, and it is the single largest known deviation in the port.
Marked at every site as `DEVIATION: tile sync widened to block barrier`.

The one true warp SHUFFLE in the whole path is in the bin prefix scan
(`cub::WarpScan<double>` plus `cub::ShuffleIndex<32>`,
`histogram_utils.cu:381`, `:413`, `:423`). That one is substitutable without
loss: a threadgroup scan computes the same values.

## 3. `float` accumulation, not fixed point

CatBoost accumulates in `float` in shared memory and flushes with a
non-deterministic global `atomicAdd` guarded by `abs(val) > 1e-20f`. Copied
as-is. This makes the port's histograms non-deterministic across runs, which
is THEIR behavior; do not "fix" it to fixed point here.

## 4. `cub::DeviceRadixSort::SortPairs` per leaf

`split_points.cu:658-689` sorts each leaf's index range on the host loop, one
CUB call per leaf, 255 of them for a depth-8 tree. CatBoost's own comments
call this out: `//TODO(noxoomo): cub sucks for this, write proper segmented
version` (`:657`) and `//TODO(noxoomo): for oblivious trees we have overhead
for launching kernel per leaf` (`split_points.cpp:53`). There is no CUB in
Mojo. Port writes a stable 1-bit partition per leaf range, which is what the
sort is being used for.
