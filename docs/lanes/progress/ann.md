# ann: progress

Pass 1 design (all lanes): every Mojo computation is a per-cell function in
`x_ann/*_core.mojo`; the GPU binding runs one cell per thread
(`x_ann/*_device.mojo`), the CPU host binding runs the SAME function in a
loop (`x_ann/host/*_host.mojo`), so the two agree by construction. Integer
graph work (t-SNE symmetrization, CAGRA prune/reverse merge, CSR lists) is
the same host function in both drivers. NOT_IMPLEMENTED: `x_ann/NOT_IMPLEMENTED.tsv`.

Pod notes: dev pods with an NVIDIA driver < 580 need
`MODULAR_NVPTX_COMPILER_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas` at build and run
time (build_x_ann.sh then names the arch from nvidia-smi). A host build that
imports `ivf/host/ivf_host.mojo` next to new code hangs the Mojo compiler
(0 CPU, futex), so IVF-PQ carries its own fixed-order Lloyd.
