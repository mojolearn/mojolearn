# trees-apple2: progress (Apple speed round 2, trees family)

Branch `lane/trees-apple2` (worktree `~/mojolearn-wt/trees-apple2`), off
lane/apple-merged 037daa353. Brief: `~/mojolearn-evidence/apple2_speed_brief.md`.
Evidence: `~/mojolearn-evidence/trees-apple2/runs/<steward id>.stdout`.

Harness: `tools/trees_apple_ab.sh` puts the before and after arms of one
change in ONE steward job (same commit, same Mac): each arm rebuilds the
named bindings with its own `MOJOLEARN_EXTRA_DEFINES` (the before arm is the
change's opt-out define), then runs `tools/trees_apple_speed.sh` on
`TAP_CELLS`; arms alternate per round.

## Changes

| commit | mode | change | opt-out define | shared code? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| c7228df55 | IDENTICAL | RF row-major bins on Apple for `n_cols <= 64` (wide data stays column-major) | `MOJOLEARN_RF_BINS_COLUMN_MAJOR` | RF builder: DT, Bagging, DART, AdaBoost, RF |
| bf5ac8dec | IDENTICAL | RF histogram zero-after-read on Apple (no per-round `hist_zero` launch); the block split kernel's zero waits on a device-scope barrier on Apple (also FAST's block kernel) | `MOJOLEARN_RF_FAST_HIST_ZERO_OFF` | RF builder, as above |
| a5f2c1d34 | IDENTICAL | ET tiled range + regression score kernels on Apple (key-space range fold under IDENTICAL) | `MOJOLEARN_ET_TILED_SEARCH_IDENTICAL_OFF` | ET builder (ExtraTrees, RandomTreesEmbedding if 2k >= n) |
