# Run a command under a wall-clock cap, portably.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# On 2026-08-18, `pixi run gpu-validate` deadlocked inside `train_gpu` on an
# NVIDIA RTX 5090. Not slowly: the main thread and all ten worker threads sat
# in `futex_wait_queue` and the process used ONE CPU tick in a five-second
# window, with the GPU at 0%. It never returned.
#
# It happened three times in a row, always stopping after the same printed
# line, and each time it was diagnosed as something else (a slow CPU oracle,
# then a large shape, then a busy machine) because a hung process and a slow
# process look identical from the outside. Hours went into that. The suite had
# already grown a timeout that morning for exactly this reason; the eighteen
# `mojo run` bench tasks in pixi.toml had none, so the one that deadlocked was
# the one with no upper bound.
#
# A benchmark that can hang is a benchmark that cannot be run unattended, and
# unattended on leased hardware billed by the hour is precisely how these get
# run.
#
# WHY NOT JUST `timeout`
#
# `timeout` is coreutils. Linux CI has it; macOS does not ship it at all, and
# Homebrew coreutils installs it as `gtimeout`. Since every development machine
# here is macOS and CI is Linux, a bare `timeout` would protect CI and silently
# do nothing where the work actually happens. So: probe for both, then fall
# back to a POSIX job-control implementation.
#
# USAGE
#
#   tools/with_timeout.sh <seconds> <command> [args...]
#
# Exit codes match coreutils `timeout`: 124 means the deadline fired. Anything
# else is the command's own status. A `<seconds>` of 0 disables the cap and
# runs the command directly, which is the escape hatch for a benchmark that
# genuinely needs longer.

# `auto` reads CBSYM_BENCH_TIMEOUT, defaulting to 1800s. The pixi task
# strings pass `auto` rather than `${CBSYM_BENCH_TIMEOUT:-1800}` because
# pixi runs tasks through its own shell, and depending on that shell's
# parameter-expansion support to set a safety limit would be a bad bet: if the
# expansion silently produced an empty string, the cap would vanish and the
# task would look protected while being unprotected. Resolving it here means
# one implementation, in a shell whose behavior is known.

  # No coreutils. Run in the background and poll for the deadline.
  #
  # SIGKILL rather than SIGTERM is deliberate: the case this exists for is a
  # futex deadlock, and a process wedged on a futex does not necessarily run a
  # signal handler. A polite signal that the target cannot act on would leave
  # the hang in place and report a clean exit, which is worse than no timeout
  # because it looks like success.
