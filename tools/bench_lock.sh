# The TIMING lock, and a liveness check for it.

#   tools/bench_lock.sh status
#   tools/bench_lock.sh acquire "<session>" "<what>" "<eta>"
#   tools/bench_lock.sh release
#   tools/bench_lock.sh take            # only when status says ABANDONED
#
# This is NOT tools/with_build_lock.sh. That one serializes heavy *builds* on
# /tmp/cbsym-build.lock through an fcntl flock, and an fcntl lock is
# released by the kernel when the holding process dies, so it has liveness for
# free and needs nothing from this file. This one guards
# /tmp/cbsym-bench.lock, the advisory TIMING lock that says a measurement
# window is open, and until now it was a hand-written text file with no tool,
# no enforcement and no way to tell a held lock from an abandoned one.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-08-16 a lane holding the timing lock died mid-window
# when three sessions were terminated at once. The file sat there with a stated
# ETA and nothing to release it. From the outside a stale lock and a busy lock
# are the same bytes: the holder, the workload and the ETA are all claims
# written at ACQUISITION by a session that may not survive to release them, and
# nothing checked whether they were still true. Another session waited on it
# correctly, and would have kept waiting.
#
# THE DIRECTION THIS FAILS IN IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Reporting a live lock as
# abandoned lets two sessions measure at once and silently corrupts both
# windows; reporting an abandoned lock as held costs somebody a wait. Those are
# not comparable, so every uncertain case here resolves to HELD. A lock is
# reported STALE-PID only when the holder's PID is positively confirmed gone.
# No `pid:` line, an unreadable file, a PID we cannot ask about: all HELD.
#
# THE PID MUST OUTLIVE THE WINDOW, AND A PER-CALL SHELL DOES NOT. Each shell
# invocation is its own process, so `acquire` from one call and `status` from
# the next will record a pid that is already gone -- correctly reported, and
# useless. Acquire from the process that will still be running when the window
# ends: hold it from inside the long-lived job, or export BENCH_LOCK_PID with a
# pid that survives. If nothing survives, record no pid, because a missing pid
# reports HELD and a dead pid invites a steal.
#
# WHAT A DEAD PID DOES AND DOES NOT TELL YOU. It tells you the recorded process
# is not running. It does NOT tell you the work finished: a shell can exit while
# the job it started keeps going, and once the pid is gone there is nothing left
# to ask -- the record that would have answered is the process that exited, and
# its children are reparented carrying no back-reference. So this reports
# STALE-PID and not ABANDONED. On 2026-08-16 a lane read the earlier wording
# while eight `mojo` processes were running at load 11. The detection was right
# both times; the word was what misled, because ABANDONED reads as permission.
#
# AND IT NEVER STEALS. `status` reports; `take` is a separate verb somebody has
# to type. The stale file is preserved under a `.dead-<session>` suffix rather
# than deleted, because what a window was doing when it died is evidence.
