# Deviations in the `extratrees/` section — reserved range 130-159

Written 2026-08-21. This lane holds deviation numbers **130-159**, assigned up
front per rule 3 (the root ledger stood at 90 when the range was reserved; the
RF lane in `ensemble/` holds 100-129).

**Why this text lives here and not in the root `PORTING.md`.** `PORTING.md` is
a file the RF lane is also appending to, concurrently, and rule 12 is explicit
that the predictor of integration pain is file convergence. Every entry below
is written in `PORTING.md`'s own format so that merging it is an append, not an
edit. Moving it is a merge-time action for whoever runs the merge. **Nothing
in this file is a deviation "recorded elsewhere later" — this IS the record,
and each one is also stated as a `DEVIATION BLOCK` banner in the file it
governs, per rule 5.**

Two upstreams are cited throughout, and every entry says which one it departs
from:

- **paper/sklearn** — Geurts, Ernst & Wehenkel 2006, with scikit-learn `1.9.0`
  (`77def0e`, `~/CascadeProjects/upstream/scikit-learn`) as the reference
  implementation of the split rule.
- **cuML** — `00094f7` (`~/CascadeProjects/upstream/cuml`), the upstream for
  the builder, the split record, the tie-break, the node layout and the RNG
  keying; RAFT `661a3b8` for the generator itself.

## 130. sklearn's draw ORDER cannot be reproduced by a parallel builder

**Theirs.** Every random number in `node_split_random` comes from one
sequential 32-bit xorshift stream: `our_rand_r`
(`sklearn/utils/_random.pxd:20-34`) advancing a single `rand_r_state` word.
Draw order is the order of the Fisher-Yates feature walk
(`_splitter.pyx:592`), and that walk's path depends on which features were
found constant, which depends on data (`_splitter.pyx:611-621`). One threshold
draw at `_splitter.pyx:633` per surviving feature, in that order.

**Ours.** Counter-based keyed draws. The key is
`(seed, tree_id, node_id, feature_id)`, hashed with the fnv1a32 chain cuML uses
for exactly this purpose (`kernels/builder_kernels.cuh:167-170` chains
`threadIdx`, `treeid`, `nodeid`) into the `subsequence` argument of RAFT's
`PCGenerator` (`raft/random/detail/rng_device.cuh:546`). Our chain adds
`feature_id`, because ET draws a threshold per (node, feature) where cuML's
sampler draws per (node, thread).

**Reason, and it is not a preference.** A sequential stream makes draw *k*
depend on draws *0..k-1*, so a builder that evaluates features in parallel
cannot produce it without serializing the thing being parallelized. The
counter-based key is order-independent by construction, which buys a property
sklearn does not have: the same tree on Metal, CUDA and HIP, and the same tree
regardless of how the frontier was batched.

**Price.** Bitwise parity with sklearn is off the table permanently. sklearn is
therefore a QUALITY-BAND oracle only (holdout accuracy/MSE), never a gate. The
exact oracle is a host-side transcription of `node_split_random` using OUR
keyed draws — see `mojo_only/host_splitter.mojo`.

## 131. The feature sampler is cuML's, not sklearn's

**Theirs (sklearn).** Fisher-Yates without replacement over a persistent
`features` array, interleaved with constant-feature bookkeeping, drawing
`max_features` survivors (`_splitter.pyx:566-624`).

**Theirs (cuML).** `excess_sample_with_replacement_kernel` /
`algo_L_sample_kernel` (`kernels/builder_kernels.cuh:152`, `:246`), selected by
a problem-size test in `builder.cuh:427`, producing `n_sampled_cols` unique
column ids per node into `colids`.

**Ours.** cuML's. It is a real GPU implementation of the same intent by people
who measured, and rule 0b-i says port the path their dispatch takes.

**Price.** Our sampled feature SET for a node differs from sklearn's at the
same seed even before 130 is considered. Both are uniform without replacement
over the same space, so the quality band is unaffected; the exact oracle
transcribes OUR sampler, not sklearn's.

---

## 132. Constant features are re-discovered per node, not inherited

**Theirs.** sklearn threads `n_constant_features` down the tree through
`ParentInfo`, so a feature found constant at an ancestor is never re-examined
and is excluded from the draw
(`_splitter.pyx:557-559`, `:585-588`, `:721-730`).

**Ours.** Each node computes its own range pass and excludes constants found
there (`max <= min + FEATURE_THRESHOLD`, `_splitter.pyx:616-617`, with
`FEATURE_THRESHOLD = 1e-7` from `_partitioner.pxd:13`). Nothing is inherited.

**Reason.** The inherited counter is an artifact of the sequential loop: it is
carried in the same `features` array the Fisher-Yates walk permutes, and the
permutation IS the state. Reproducing it would serialize the frontier.

**Price, and it is paid twice.** (a) Work: a constant feature is re-scanned at
every descendant that samples it. The range pass is one gather-min/max, so the
cost is bounded by the range pass itself; it is NOT re-scored, because a
constant feature is excluded before the draw. (b) Behaviour: because sklearn
excludes known constants from the DRAW, its effective `max_features` over
non-constant features is larger than ours deep in the tree. This is a real
quality difference on datasets with many constant columns and is what the
adversarial constant-feature fixture exists to expose.

## 133. Tie-break is cuML's total order, not sklearn's first-wins

**Theirs (sklearn).** `if current_proxy_improvement > best_proxy_improvement`
(`_splitter.pyx:690`) — strictly greater, so on a tie the FIRST candidate in
sequential draw order survives. That is not a total order; it is a statement
about loop order.

**Ours.** `Split::update` from `split.cuh:78-90`, transcribed branch for
branch: greater metric wins; on equal metric the greater `colid` wins; on equal
colid the greater `quesval` wins.

**Reason.** Loop order does not exist here (130). A total order over the
candidate's own fields is the only tie-break that is reproducible when the
candidates are reduced in an unspecified order, and cuML already wrote it.

---

## 134. NOT a deviation: the partition is cuML's swap partition, ported

This entry started life as a deviation ("ours will be a stable partition") and
is kept, rewritten, because reading the upstream killed it — which is the
outcome rule 1 predicts and rule 10 says to write down rather than quietly drop.

**What reading `builder_kernels_impl.cuh:43-88` (`partitionSamples`) found.**
cuML does the split partition IN PLACE on `dataset.row_ids`, with a two-pointer
block algorithm: each side scans for "misfits" (`col[row_ids[loff]] >
split.quesval` on the left, `col[row_ids[roff]] <= split.quesval` on the right),
compacts them through two `cub::BlockScan` exclusive sums, and SWAPS the paired
misfits. It is not stable, and it does not need to be.

**Two things that fall out of their code and are worth stating.**

1. **Left is `<= quesval`.** `builder_kernels_impl.cuh:65-66` tests
   `col[...] > quesval` for a left-side misfit, so a row equal to the threshold
   stays left. That is the same convention as sklearn's `partition_samples`
   (`_partitioner.pyx:233-236`, `feature_values[...] <= threshold` goes left).
   **The two upstreams agree**, so the boundary row has one answer here and no
   deviation is needed for it.
2. **Their partition is deterministic.** Given the block size, the sequence of
   scans, compactions and swaps is fixed; nothing about it depends on warp
   scheduling. So the row order inside a child is reproducible, and the host
   oracle can transcribe it exactly rather than being forced to compare
   order-insensitively. A stable partition of our own would have bought the
   same property at the cost of departing from the upstream for no measured
   reason, which is the trade rule 1 forbids.

**Ours.** Theirs, transcribed, with the `cub::BlockScan` exclusive sums written
against `max.gpu.primitives.block` — a language-level counterpart, explicitly
allowed by `PORTING_RULES.md` 0b-i and not a vendor-library substitution.

## 135. OPEN — score accumulation precision on device

**Theirs.** sklearn accumulates class counts and label sums in `float64`
(`_criterion.pyx`, `sum_left`/`sum_right` are `float64_t[::1]`), and the MSE
proxy is `sum_left^2/n_left + sum_right^2/n_right` (`_criterion.pyx:944-975`).

**Ours.** There is no `float64` on device (root traps register). For
CLASSIFICATION this is not a problem and is not a deviation: with the default
`sample_weight=None` the class counts are integers, so the Gini proxy is an
exact rational in integer arithmetic. For REGRESSION the label sums are floats
and a parallel reduction has no fixed order.

**Status: OPEN, and it is the one design fork this lane cannot settle from an
upstream** — `gbdt/` solved the same problem with fixed-point label scaling
(`mojo_only/fixed_point.mojo`, `choose_scale`), which is a precedent inside
this repository rather than an invention. Resolving it is a decision recorded
in `PLAN.md`; nothing downstream is blocked on it because the classification
path is exact either way.

## 136. Missing values (NaN) are refused, not randomized

**Theirs.** sklearn sends missing values left or right by a COIN FLIP per
candidate (`_splitter.pyx:649`, `missing_go_to_left = rand_int(0, 2, ...)`),
and `find_min_max` counts NaNs into `n_missing` (`_partitioner.pyx:152-155`).

**Ours.** Refused by name at the API boundary, the way `gbdt/`'s `check()`
refuses every unported CatBoost option. A NaN in the input is an error, not a
silently different tree.

**Reason.** It is one more keyed draw per candidate and it is not hard; it is
simply not ported yet, and rule 3 says an unported thing must be visible. A
refusal is visible; a wrong answer is not.

**Price.** Datasets with missing values are forfeit until this is ported.
Tracked in `UNPORTED.tsv`.
